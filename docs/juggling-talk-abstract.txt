Session Title: Juggling data structures
Session Abstract:
    I will literally juggle.
    I will describe a notation for recording juggling patterns.
    And then describe a compiler to use the notation as a sort of DSL.

    I'm open and approachable person with a strong curiosity for 
    all things technical; I also enjoy juggling.
    So I am trying to combine my two passions and build some open source tools
    to help jugglers learn tricks and even discover new ones.
